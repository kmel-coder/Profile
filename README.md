# GreetingsðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Kim, a data scientist who once hit a stagnant phase but is now reigniting my passion for coding and continuous learning. 
After taking a step back, I'm diving back into the world of data, algorithms, and new technologies with fresh curiosity and determination.

ðŸ§  Rediscovering my love for solving problems through data and code. I am currently developing an interactive web profile to showcase my 
skills and attract potential employers. As part of my ongoing learning journey, I am exploring new tools and techniques to create a compelling 
online presence.

ðŸ’» Brushing up on R, SQL and exploring new technologies

ðŸŒ± Focused on leveling up through open-source contributions and exciting side projects

Let's connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects that inspire growth and creativity!
