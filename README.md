Hello! I'm Kim, a data scientist who once hit a stagnant phase but is now reigniting my passion for coding and continuous learning. 
After taking a step back, I'm diving back into the world of data, algorithms, and new technologies with fresh curiosity and determination.

ðŸ§  Rediscovering my love for solving problems through data and code

ðŸ’» Brushing up on R, SQL and exploring new technologies

ðŸŒ± Focused on leveling up through open-source contributions and exciting side projects

Let's connect, share knowledge, and collaborate on projects that inspire growth and creativity!
